# Lab 05 - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
Based on the definition of DIP:
- Dependency inversion states that objects should not be strongly coupled. It allows switching to an alternate dependency easily.
- It focuses on the approach where the higher classes are not dependent on the lower classes instead depend upon the abstraction of the lower classes.
- High and low-level objects should depend on abstraction, but abstraction should not depend on details.
- The perfect way to solve this problem is with **interfaces**.

## Problem
- The following example is with errors.
- Fix the architecture of this example using DIP
